        <ul>
            <li>Phishing is one of the most frequent forms of cyber crime, but despite how much we think
                we know about these scams, they still catch us out all too often.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">The message is sent from a public email domain.</span> No
                legitimate organisation will send emails from an address that ends '@gmail.com'.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">The domain name is misspelt.</span> There’s another clue hidden in
                domain names that provides a strong indication of phishing scams ­– unfortunately, it
                complicates our previous clue.</li>
            <li><span class="fw-bold">The email is poorly written.</span> You can often tell if an email
                is a scam if it contains poor spelling and grammar.</li>

        <h2 class="fs-4 text-secondary">How our model works</h2>
        <p class="fs-6">In order to detect and predict phishing websites, we proposed an intelligent, flexible
            and effective system that is based on using classification algorithms. We implemented classification
            algorithms and techniques to extract the phishing datasets criteria to classify their legitimacy.
            The phishing website can be detected based on some important characteristics like URL and domain
            identity, and security and encryption criteria in the final phishing detection rate.</p>
